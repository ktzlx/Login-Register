Main.java must be run for gui to work as intended.

The other .java's are pages and all have codes in them that connect to the database and
use SQL statements such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

In this application, the user will be able to register, login, update and delete their account.
At the moment, this application is solely meant to deal only with account creation/settings.
